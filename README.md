# Personal Portfolio Website – Description

The task involved designing and developing a personal portfolio website for a frontend developer. The purpose of this website is to introduce the developer, showcase their services and skills, provide a platform to display portfolio projects, and allow potential clients or collaborators to get in touch. It's an essential asset for freelancers, job seekers, and professionals looking to build their personal brand online.

The website is built using HTML and CSS, which are the foundational tools for front-end web development. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content and elements on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, buttons, forms, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the content and layout, allowing us to create visually appealing designs with colors, fonts, spacing, responsiveness, and animations.

Tools and Technologies Used

1. HTML5: Used for creating the structure of the website. Elements such as <header>, <section>, <nav>, <form>, and semantic tags help in organizing content and improving accessibility.


2. CSS3: Used for styling the layout, fonts, colors, buttons, forms, and more. Features like Flexbox and gradients help in responsive design and modern UI layouts.


3. Font Awesome (CDN): Integrated for using social media and icon fonts like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, code icons, and more. It enhances visual communication without using image files.


4. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The project is developed and edited using VS Code, a powerful and popular code editor used by developers for writing, testing, and previewing code.


5. Responsive Design: Although simple, the layout is structured to adapt to different screen sizes using flexible box layouts (Flexbox) and scalable units.



Sections and Their Purpose

Home: It introduces the developer with a profile image, name, role (Frontend Developer), and call-to-action buttons like "Hire Me" and "Let's Talk".

About: Describes the developer’s background, experience, and passion for frontend development. This helps visitors understand who the person is beyond just skills.

Services: Highlights the key services offered — such as web development, UI/UX design, and responsive design. Each service is visually represented with icons and brief descriptions.

Portfolio: A placeholder section intended to showcase projects. This could be expanded later to display real websites or applications the developer has built.

Contact: A form that allows users to input their name, email, and message to get in touch. Although not connected to a backend yet, it sets up the UI for interaction.



Use Case

This website is ideal for freelancers, job seekers, students, and developers wanting to establish an online presence. It’s useful when sharing resumes, applying for jobs, or networking online. Recruiters and clients can easily learn about the person, view their work, and contact them — all from a single page.

In summary, this project demonstrates a complete personal branding site using only HTML and CSS, built to work seamlessly in Visual Studio Code and viewable in any modern browser.
